# SFM-Reconstruction

SFM-Reconstruction creates sparse 3D model using Structure from Motion method. This project is built with OpenCV 3.4 and contrib modules.

Before you run with your own images, you could run the example by copying some of the images `003.png` `004.png` `005.png` to your build folder, and compile the code. The output `pointcloud.ply` file could be viewed in Meshlab.
